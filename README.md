# My Very First Web Page

Welcome!

## This is my first project for the Full Stack Diploma in Software Development.

### I have created a website using HTML and CSS code. 

#### I have used Cloud9 to write my code and assemble my files for the html and css contained in my website.
#### After completing the website's code I began to learn about CLI. Since this morning I have commited the files to my repository on GitHub and then tested the website url I was provided.
#### I am now completing a challenge by describing what I have just done in the README.md file. Now I shall commit this also and move on to the next stage.

 PS. I have read the Markdown Cheatsheet hence the italic-bold signature.
